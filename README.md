# bits-wifi-logger
Automatically connect to bits wifi without taking the hassle of entering your bits id and password everytime.
## How to automate?
I automate it by simply adding the file to the i3 window manager on startup auto run config. However feel free to use it as a keybind as well or find other solutions to automate this process based on your os and distro.
